Kate phpDoc plugin
------------------
This plugin adds a new command under the "Tools" menu in `Kate <http://www.kde.org/applications/utilities/kate/>`_ that adds a php docblock comment on class, methods, functions and class variables.

The plugin can also be invoked with the shortcut **Meta+D** (Meta is usually the Windows key).

Installation
''''''''''''
Copy or link the phpdoc directory under *~/.kde4/share/apps/kate/pate* to install it only for the current user, or do the same in */usr/share/apps/kate/pate* to do it globally.

Requirements
''''''''''''
This plugin is developed in python and requires the `Pâté plugin system <https://github.com/pag/pate>`_ for Kate to be installed.

The PHP interpreter must also be present to allow for sourcecode parsing.
